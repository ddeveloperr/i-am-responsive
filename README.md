### i-am-responsive - Building Responsive web site project!
===========================================================
I learned a lot from this project and it contains the following parts:
- Media Queries
- Horizontal navigation
- Two level deep navigation
- Phone navigation
- Multiple columns
- Scalable images
- Image sprites
- Font based icons
- Optimized with SCSS and on the end when site loading we can see only 13 HTTP request! Fast and cool!

This is [live demo] (http://ddeveloperr.github.io/i-am-responsive/) for Final project.
